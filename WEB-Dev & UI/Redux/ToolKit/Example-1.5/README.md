# Redux Essentials Tutorial Example

This project contains the setup and code from the "Redux Essentials" tutorial example app in the Redux docs ( https://redux.js.org/tutorials/essentials/part-3-data-flow ).

The `master` branch has a single commit that already has the initial project configuration in place. You can use this as the starting point to follow along with the instructions from the tutorial.

The `tutorial-steps-ts` branch has the actual code commits from the tutorial. You can look at these to see how the official tutorial actually implements each piece of functionality along the way.

This project was bootstrapped with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/), and is based on the [official Redux Toolkit + Vite template](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-templates/tree/master/packages/vite-template-redux).

## Package Managers

This project is currently set up to use [Yarn 4](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/usage) as the package manager.

If you prefer to use another package manager, such as NPM, PNPM, or Bun, delete the `"packageManager"` section from `package.json` and the `.yarnrc.yml` and `yarn.lock` files, then install dependencies with your preferred package manager.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn dev`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:4173](http://localhost:4173) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `dist` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
