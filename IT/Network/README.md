| Layer   | Name         | Description                                                                                                                                                | Examples                                                         |
| ------- | ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Layer 1 | Physical     | This layer is responsible for the physical connection between devices. It handles the transmission of raw binary data over physical mediums.               | Ethernet cables, fiber optics, hubs, switches, radio frequencies |
| Layer 2 | Data Link    | Provides node-to-node data transfer and handles error detection and correction from the Physical layer. It also defines the protocol for data frames.      | MAC addresses, switches, VLANs                                   |
| Layer 3 | Network      | Manages the routing of data packets between devices across different networks, including addressing and path selection.                                    | IP addresses, routers, IPv4/IPv6                                 |
| Layer 4 | Transport    | Ensures complete data transfer with error checking, flow control, and retransmission of lost data. It controls the reliability of the connection.          | TCP, UDP, port numbers                                           |
| Layer 5 | Session      | Manages and controls the connections between computers, including establishing, maintaining, and terminating sessions.                                     | Sessions, NetBIOS, RPC                                           |
| Layer 6 | Presentation | Translates data between the application layer and the network. It handles data encryption, compression, and formatting.                                    | SSL/TLS, JPEG, GIF, encryption, decryption                       |
| Layer 7 | Application  | The layer closest to the end-user, providing network services to applications. It facilitates communication between software applications and the network. | HTTP, FTP, SMTP, DNS, web browsers                               |
