### Additional Notes

- **When to use color scales (e.g., Heatmaps, Choropleth Maps):** Color coding is excellent for intensity mapping, but you should ensure color-blind friendly palettes for accessibility.
- **Interactive Visualizations:** Tools like Bubble Charts or Network Graphs often benefit from interactive visualization libraries (e.g., Plotly, D3.js) for added depth and usability.
- **General Tips for Choosing a Visualization Tool:**
  - Always match the visualization to your data type and the story you want to tell.
  - Avoid clutter and overcomplicating visuals.
  - Simpler charts (like Line or Bar) are often more impactful than complex alternatives.
