# Math

## Common Coding Questions

### Prefix Sum

- Use When: You need to calculate the sum of sub-arrays efficiently.
- Example: Sub-array Sum Equals K, Range Sum Query.

### Prefix/Suffix Products

- Use When: You need to calculate the product of all elements except the current one without division.
- Example: Traverse left-to-right and right-to-left to build the result array in O(n).

### Modular Arithmetic

- Use When: You need to manage large numbers or wrap around values in cyclic structures.
- Example: Checking if a number is divisible by another, circular array problems.

### XOR Properties

- Finding single number in array of duplicates
- Swapping numbers without extra space

### Binary Representation

- Bit manipulation problems
- Counting set bits

### Fibonacci Sequence

- Dynamic programming problems

### Pigeonhole Principle

- Finding duplicates in certain ranges

### Geometric Principles

- Problems involving points, lines, or shapes

### Combinatorics

- Calculating number of possible combinations/permutations

### Matrix Operations

- Transpose, rotation, spiral traversal

### Prime Numbers and Factorization

- Sieve of Eratosthenes for prime generation
- Prime factorization in optimization problems
