# Floyd's Cycle Detection

## Solves

- Detecting cycles in linked lists
- Finding the start of a cycle in a linked list
- Detecting cycles in sequences (e.g., in number theory problems)
- Optimizing space complexity in certain graph algorithms

## Key characteristics

- Uses two pointers moving at different speeds (usually one at single speed, one at double speed)
- Detects cycle in O(n) time and O(1) space
- Can find the start of the cycle with an additional step after cycle detection

## Common applications in coding problems

- Linked List Cycle (detecting if a linked list has a cycle)
- Linked List Cycle II (finding the node where the cycle begins)
- Find the Duplicate Number (in an array where values are in range [1, n])
- Happy Number problem (determining if a number is "happy")
