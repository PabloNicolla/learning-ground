# Sharding Strategy

## Introduction

When designing a data model for a large PostgreSQL database that will be sharded, it's essential to follow best practices to ensure scalability, performance, and maintainability. Below are key considerations:

---

### **1. Choose the Right Sharding Key**

- **Consistency:** Select a sharding key that evenly distributes data across shards to prevent hotspots.
- **Query Patterns:** Ensure the sharding key supports the most common queries. For example:
  - Use a user ID for user-specific queries.
  - Use a timestamp for time-series data.
- **Data Locality:** Ensure related data is stored in the same shard to minimize cross-shard operations.

---

### **2. Normalize vs. Denormalize Carefully**

- **Normalization:**
  - Useful for reducing redundancy and keeping the data consistent.
  - Avoid deep normalization that requires excessive joins across shards.
- **Denormalization:**
  - Optimize for read-heavy workloads by duplicating data to reduce cross-shard joins.
  - Use materialized views or caching layers for aggregate queries.

---

### **3. Partitioning Strategy**

- **Hash Partitioning:** Distributes data evenly based on a hash function applied to the sharding key. Good for uniform distribution.
- **Range Partitioning:** Shards data based on ranges (e.g., dates). Suitable for time-series data or sequential identifiers.
- **List Partitioning:** Use categorical values (e.g., regions, countries).

---

### **4. Avoid Cross-Shard Joins**

- Design the schema to minimize queries that span multiple shards.
- If cross-shard joins are unavoidable:
  - Implement application-side joins.
  - Use distributed query engines like **Citus** or **CockroachDB**.

---

### **5. Plan for Shard Rebalancing**

- Use surrogate keys or UUIDs with a hash-based distribution strategy.
- Avoid hardcoding shard IDs in your application logic.
- Keep track of metadata (e.g., shard mappings) in a **catalog database** to simplify rebalancing.

---

### **6. Use Connection Pooling**

- Employ tools like **PgBouncer** or **Pgpool-II** to manage connections efficiently, especially with multiple shards.

---

### **7. Optimize Indexing**

- Index the sharding key and any columns commonly used in queries.
- Consider composite indexes for complex query patterns.
- Regularly monitor and rebuild indexes to prevent bloat.

---

### **8. Monitor Performance**

- Use PostgreSQL extensions like **pg_stat_statements** for query analysis.
- Monitor shard health with tools like **Prometheus** and visualize metrics in **Grafana**.

---

### **9. Handle Transactions Carefully**

- Prefer single-shard transactions whenever possible.
- For multi-shard transactions:
  - Use a two-phase commit (2PC), though this adds complexity.
  - Explore external tools like **Kafka** or **RabbitMQ** to decouple operations.

---

### **10. Backup and Disaster Recovery**

- Implement shard-level backups and test recovery procedures.
- Use tools like **pg_dump**, **pg_basebackup**, or third-party solutions.

---

### **11. Consider Extensions and Tools**

- **Citus:** Adds distributed database capabilities to PostgreSQL.
- **pg_shard:** Simplifies sharding in PostgreSQL.
- **Foreign Data Wrappers (FDW):** For querying data across shards when necessary.

---

### **12. Plan for Growth**

- Allocate additional shard slots during initial design to simplify future scaling.
- Use a consistent hashing algorithm to minimize data movement during shard addition.
