## Overview

This guide covers different strategies for managing offsets in Kafka consumers, their implications, and best practices for implementation.

## Understanding Offset Management

### What are Offsets?

- Unique sequential ID assigned to messages in a partition
- Used to track message consumption progress
- Stored in internal Kafka topic `__consumer_offsets`
- Critical for message delivery guarantees

### Responsibilities

- **Kafka Cluster**:
  - Stores committed offsets
  - Maintains offset history
  - Provides offset recovery
  - Ensures offset replication
  
- **Consumer**:
  - Tracks processing progress
  - Decides when to commit
  - Manages commit strategy
  - Handles offset reset logic

## Offset Commit Strategies

### 1. Auto Commit

#### How it Works

- Kafka automatically commits offsets at fixed intervals
- No explicit commit calls needed in code
- Based on time or message count threshold

#### Advantages

- ✅ Simple implementation
- ✅ Less code to maintain
- ✅ Good for simple use cases
- ✅ Minimal development overhead

#### Disadvantages

- ❌ Risk of message loss
- ❌ Possible duplicate processing
- ❌ Less control over commit timing
- ❌ Not suitable for critical data

#### When to Use

- Processing non-critical data
- Simple stream processing
- When duplicate processing is acceptable
- High-throughput scenarios with basic requirements

### 2. Manual Commit

#### How it Works

- Explicit offset commits in code
- Complete control over commit timing
- Can commit after successful processing

#### Advantages

- ✅ Precise control
- ✅ Better message delivery guarantees
- ✅ Clearer processing boundaries
- ✅ Easier to implement transactions

#### Disadvantages

- ❌ More complex code
- ❌ Need to handle commit failures
- ❌ Higher development overhead
- ❌ Requires careful error handling

#### When to Use

- Processing critical data
- When exactly-once processing is needed
- Complex transaction scenarios
- When message loss is unacceptable

### 3. Batch Commit

#### How it Works

- Commits offsets after processing multiple messages
- Batches can be size or time-based
- Balance between performance and reliability

#### Advantages

- ✅ Better performance
- ✅ Reduced network overhead
- ✅ Good for high-throughput
- ✅ Balance of control and efficiency

#### Disadvantages

- ❌ More complex implementation
- ❌ Larger reprocessing batches on failure
- ❌ Need careful batch size tuning
- ❌ Memory considerations for batch size

#### When to Use

- High-throughput scenarios
- When performance is important
- Processing can be batched
- Balance needed between reliability and performance

## Best Practices

### 1. Error Handling

- Implement proper retry logic
- Consider dead letter queues
- Handle commit failures gracefully
- Log offset commits for debugging

### 2. Performance Tuning

```plaintext
Factors to Consider:
- Batch size
- Commit interval
- Processing time
- Resource usage
- Network overhead
```

### 3. Monitoring

- Track offset lag
- Monitor commit success rates
- Watch for consumer group rebalances
- Alert on processing delays

### 4. Recovery Strategies

```plaintext
1. Automatic Reset:
   - earliest: Read from start
   - latest: Read new messages only
   
2. Manual Reset:
   - Specific offset
   - Timestamp-based
   - Custom logic
```

## Decision Framework

### Choose Auto Commit when

- 🎯 Building simple consumers
- 🎯 Message loss is acceptable
- 🎯 Want minimal code complexity
- 🎯 Processing non-critical data

### Choose Manual Commit when

- 🎯 Processing critical data
- 🎯 Need exactly-once processing
- 🎯 Implementing transactions
- 🎯 Want full control

### Choose Batch Commit when

- 🎯 High-throughput requirements
- 🎯 Performance is critical
- 🎯 Processing naturally batched
- 🎯 Balance needed between reliability and performance

## Implementation Guidelines

### 1. Auto Commit Setup

```typescript
const consumer = kafka.consumer({
  groupId: 'my-group',
  autoCommit: true,
  autoCommitInterval: 5000,
  autoCommitThreshold: 100
});
```

### 2. Manual Commit Setup

```typescript
const consumer = kafka.consumer({
  groupId: 'my-group',
  autoCommit: false
});

// Commit after processing
await consumer.commitOffsets([
  {
    topic,
    partition,
    offset: offset + 1
  }
]);
```

### 3. Batch Commit Setup

```typescript
let messages = [];
const BATCH_SIZE = 100;

// Collect messages
messages.push(message);
if (messages.length >= BATCH_SIZE) {
  await processAndCommitBatch(messages);
  messages = [];
}
```
